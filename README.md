# font_awesomex

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tlux/font_awesomex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tlux/font_awesomex)

A library that provides a helper to easily integrate
[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) into your
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) application.

**This repository does not contain the Font Awesome font and stylesheets.**

## Prerequisites

* Elixir (>= 1.3)
* Font Awesome 4 (use your favorite package manager like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome))

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

Add `font_awesomex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:font_awesomex, "~> 4.0.0"}]
end
```

## Usage

TBD

## What's missing

* Support for icon stacking

## Contribution

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented
  or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
  and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution. Make sure to add
  tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
